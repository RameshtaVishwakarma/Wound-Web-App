<h1>Wound Analysis <span class="yellow-heading">REPORT</span></h1>
<p>A chronic wound is a wound that does not heal in an orderly set of stages and in a predictable amount of time or wounds that do not heal within three months are often considered chronic. Chronic wounds often remain in the inflammatory stage for too long and may never heal or may take years. Chronic wound patients often report pain as dominant in their lives. Persistent pain is the main problem for patients with chronic ulcers. Many wounds pose no challenge to the bodyâ€™s innate ability to heal; some wounds, however, may not heal easily either because of the severity of the wounds themselves or because of the poor state of health of the individual. Any wound that does not heal within a few weeks should be examined by a healthcare professional because it might be infected, might reflect an underlying disease.<br>

<h1>First Aid <span class="yellow-heading">Treatment</span></h1>
<p class="left-bullet">Clean and wash your hands.Caring for the wound with hands covered in everyday bacteria will increase the likelihood of an infection later on.</p>
<p class="left-bullet">Rinse and clean the abrasion.
    Hold the affected area under lukewarm tap water for a couple of minutes. Do not aggressively scrub the wound. Attempt to gently remove any dirt or other particles.</p>
<p class="left-bullet">Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment.
    This will help keep the affected area moist and prevent infection. If you notice the formation of a rash or redness due to antibiotic ointment use, suspend use of the ointment.</p>
<p class="left-bullet">Protect and cover the abrasion.
    Use a clean bandage or a piece of gauze with tape. This helps keep the wound clean, prevents bacteria from infecting the area and helps keep the wound from reopening.</p>
